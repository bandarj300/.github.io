## About Me

Welcome to my personal website. I am a student with interests in political science, data analysis, and quantitative methods. This site showcases my academic work, including projects and visualisations from GV300.

## Academic Interests

- Quantitative political analysis
- Data visualisation and communication
- Statistical methods in social science
- Reproducible research practices

## Current Work

I am currently enrolled in GV300, where I apply computational methods to political science questions. Browse my [GV300 Showcase](gv300-showcase.html) to see examples of my best code and visualisations from the course.
