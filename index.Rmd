## About Me

Welcome to my personal github website. I am a final year student who's studying Politics and International Relations and have an interest in data analysis, and quantitative methods. This site showcases a chapter of my academic work, including a homework rmd that i've chosen to showcase as an example of work that I have conducted in the past and visualisations for GV300.

## Academic Interests

- Quantitative political analysis
- Data visualisation and communication
- Statistical methods in social science
- Reproducible research practices

## Current Work

I am currently enrolled in GV300, where I apply computational methods to political science questions. Browse my [GV300 Showcase](gv300-showcase.html) to see the example of my favorite code and visualisations from the course.
